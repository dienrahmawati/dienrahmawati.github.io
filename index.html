          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As a computer engineering student, I am committed to creating assistive technology that empowers people with disabilities while also caring for the environment. I believe technology should be inclusive, accessible, and sustainable. It should improve lives without harming the planet.
            My vision is to develop intelligent and energy-efficient systems that support independence, mobility, and communication. I want to focus on solutions that serve both people and the environment by using thoughtful design, efficient hardware, and smart software. Through innovation and collaboration, I hope to make a real difference in building a more inclusive and environmentally conscious future.
